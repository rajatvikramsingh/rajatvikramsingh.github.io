As more and more vehicles continue to crowd the roads, the traffic jams are becoming an everyday norm. To help the user drive to his destination without being stuck in jams, we propose an application that will help the user make an informed choice regarding his route and possibly avoid crowded routes. Assuming there will be many other users, each userâ€™s location and moving speed will be aggregated at the data center and thus the places where traffic is stuck will be determined and the updates will be broadcasted on Twitter. Using these updates, another user, who would be setting out to travel, can alter his route according to his convenience. [[Github]](https://github.com/rajatvikramsingh/TwiTraffic)
