The ultimate aim of any search engine is to provide relevant search results to the user in order to satisfy his information need. Search results can be improved if the user provides a feedback to the system with the documents that he found useful. This is called relevance feedback. In this project, we have used head movements of the user as a form of implicit relevance feedback. The main reason for using head movements is that users don't have to explicitly mark out relevant results, the system uses involuntary gestures of the user, making it less tedious.

The project was divided into two parts - (i) Gesture recognition and (ii) Relevance feedback. Gesture recognition was achieved using optical flow and tracking features. We have used relevance feedback for Automatic Query Reformulation. The system worked well in both recognizing gestures and providing relevant results to the user based on the feedback. The users who used the system found it helpful but not fully unobtrusive. Using this study we can infer that better, improved and more relevant search results can be obtained by using user's gestures.tion along the vertebral column. A robust solution was developed for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions.
