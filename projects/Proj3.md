Facial expression constitutes 55 percent of the effect of a communicated message and is hence a major modality in human communication. Literature establishes that there are six basic emotions that a person shows. Most of the emotions can be mapped as a combination of these emotions. These emotions are: Joy, Sad, Disgust, Anger, Surprise and Fear. A lot of different approaches have been developed for this problem. The solutions revolve around techniques in feature extraction to machine learning techniques. In the project, a paper which talks about recognising facial expressions in real time video using support vector machines was implemented. The paper talks about using a Support Vector Machines, on the features extracted from the consecutive frames of an expression using active shape models trained for facial features.
