Visual cryptography is a unique kind of cryptography which is used to encrypt printed texts, handwritten notes and pictures such that the decryption can be done only by the human visual system. This unique property of visual cryptography makes decryption process unattainable even with the help of a brute force attack, as it requires a constant human intervention to check whether the decoded image is valid or not. Visual cryptography, derived from the basic theory of secret sharing, extends the same sharing scheme to images in such a way that no single share reveals information about the original image. It finds its applications in sharing multimedia information secrets over the network, in thresholding the access to a bank account for example out of 6 participants only n such that 2<=n<=6 can combine the share of the key given to them and access the bank account.
