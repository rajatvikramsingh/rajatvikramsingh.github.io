Implemented the 2015 ICCV paper of the same title by Tzionas et al. for the Computer Vision course project. A symmetric, texture-less, feature-less 3D object was reconstructed from 2D images of the object being rotated by a hand. The point cloud of the hand was used to register the object point cloud.
