PhishBook is a cross-network user-profiling study wherein the social networking site Facebook was mined to collect publically available information of subjects to identify their “group of friends” and gain useful insights to increase the yield of a phishing attack. This involved identifying the susceptibilities of a subject towards people of same network, gender and with mutual friends on Facebook by creating fake as well as duplicate identities and thereby duping the subjects to gain access to their hidden information. This information was then further used in structuring the phishing attacks for profiling the users based on their vulnerabilities. Overall, it was found that the human tendency is to fall for social phishing attacks within their “group of friend” and also more the closeness of nodes in the social graph, more is the probability of them falling for such attacks. Gender was found to have a significant impact on the male segment only.
This project was selected for [IIITD Research Showcase 2011](http://sites.iiitd.ac.in/rs11/projects.html).  [[Report]](/media/PhishBook.pdf)
