title: Convert srt to txt file - regex
---

I recently wanted to extract the text from a srt file and tried different approaches. It can be easily done using regular expressions and a text editor which can search using regex. 
A typical srt file:

```
1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,180
Spoken Line 1

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,290
Spoken Line 2
```

You can use the following regex for identifying the line number and the time range:
```
\n?([0-9]+)\n([0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{3}) --> ([0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{3})\n
```

Use this regex in a text editor like Sublime Text and replace it with blank. You will get the following:

```
Spoken Line 1
Spoken Line 2
```

You can do more processing if you want. Try it!
